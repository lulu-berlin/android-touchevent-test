# android-touchevent-test

This repository is just a simple test to make the touch events `touchstart`, `touchmove` and `touchend` work on android. 
There's a green canvas in the middle of the screen and once touched the event that was fired along with the coordinates
(of the first touch) appear on top.

The test can be run from https://yever.github.io/android-touchevent-test/

It only works on mobile and tested only on android.
